# Machine Learning Course

Welcome to the Machine Learning Course repository. This repository contains exercises focused on key machine learning concepts, such as Bayesian linear regression, polynomial feature expansion, and uncertainty quantification.

## Directory Structure

### Exercises

The `Exercises` directory includes several sub-directories, each containing exercises that explore different aspects of machine learning.

#### Exercise 1

- **Results**: Contains visualizations generated during the exercise.
- **phi_problem.py**: Script implementing Bayesian linear regression with different polynomial features.

#### Exercise 2

- **Results**: Contains visualizations generated during the exercise.
- **main.py**: Script exploring further polynomial features and model uncertainty.

Each sub-directory has its own `README.md` providing a brief overview and instructions for the respective exercise.

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the desired exercise sub-directory.
2. Review the `README.md` file for an overview and instructions.
3. Run the provided Python scripts to execute the exercises.
4. Check the `Results` folder for visual outputs generated by the scripts.

This repository is designed to help you gain practical experience in applying machine learning techniques and understanding their outcomes.
